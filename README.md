# Capybara::Blanket

Originally developed by [Keyvan Fatehi](https://github.com/keyvanfatehi) as [cucumer-blanket](https://github.com/keyvanfatehi/cucumber-blanket).

Works to extract accumulated [Blanket.js](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket) coverage data
from the browser from a Capybara environment. Accumulated, in this context, means that coverage data
is accumulated from scenario to scenario, in an additive fashion.

This gem is under development, so I **dont recommend to use it now** â€” everything could change shortly.

## Installation

Yet not available.

## Usage

Supports minitest only for now.

To use this gem, you need to add those lines in your test_helper:

    require 'capybara/blanket'
    require 'capybara/blanket/minitest'

If you use sprockets, you need to divide your js files vendor files and application, so you wont get vendor files coverage.

Then add 'data-cover' attriute to all files you need coverage for:

    ...
    = javascript_include_tag "vendor"
    = javascript_include_tag "application", "data-cover" => true
    ...

Then you need to add 'blanket' and 'capybara-blanket' files to you template:

    = javascript_include_tag 'blanket'
    = javascript_include_tag 'capybara-blanket'

After all, you need to get coverage data after every page visiting in your tests like this:

    page = visit '/sessions/new'
    Capybara::Blanket.extract_from page
