# Capybara::Blanket

Originally developed by [Keyvan Fatehi](https://github.com/keyvanfatehi) as [cucumer-blanket](https://github.com/keyvanfatehi/cucumber-blanket).

Works to extract accumulated [Blanket.js](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket) coverage data
from the browser from a Capybara environment. Accumulated, in this context, means that coverage data
is accumulated from scenario to scenario, in an additive fashion.
